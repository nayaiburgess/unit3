# unit3

Originally, I had planned to create a website that allowed users to purchase new and used McLarens. I ran into A LOT of issues which caused me to start completely over Thursday afternoon. I then decided to make my project much simpler. I created PlaylistMe which allows users to create a profile and also create at list of their top 10 favorite songs.
